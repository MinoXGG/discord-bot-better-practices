# Better practices for Public Discord bots

* NB : These suggestions have nothing to do with private bots * 

1.  ** Name of the bot **. The name should not be trivial or funny (*in some cases you can like a meme bot ..*), because by doing so you will lose users' trust.
2.  ** Image of the bot **. The logo or image must be consistent with the colors, change it on occasions and holidays, making the bot light on the server and its users
3.  ** Idea of the bot **. New or old, but the bot must remain in a stable condition and not change the idea before or after the bot is tied
4. ** Trust of the bot ** . The bot need to get users and servers owners trust. Do not spy or use tools on your public , and don't advertise your things on the bot like ( DM Advertising , Status Advertising or Using commands and showing advertising )
